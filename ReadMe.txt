Getting Started:

There are two basic ways to use MyInventory. The easist would be to bind keys to open the MyInventory Window and to open the MyInventory config panel.  From the control panel, you can change almost all the options in MyInventory. Options ommitted from the Config panel include lock and bagview, because these options are available on the MyInventory window itself.
